## 🎯 Problem Statement:

- The objective of this project is to analyze user behavior on the Road Accident using Exploratory Data Analysis. 
- The challenge is to uncover insights into user preferences, viewing patterns, and trends by analyzing a real-world dataset sourced from Kaggle.
  - Casualites by vehicle type.
  - Casualites by Road type.
  - Casualites by Urban/Rural areas.
  - Create slicers to assess case severity in different Road surface and Weather conditions.
  - Casualites by location.
- This analysis will provide valuable information for content creators, marketers, and platform optimization.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following sheets in the Power Bi:

- **Data Sheet:** Contains the cleaned and processed data after performing data cleaning, merging, and transformations using Power Query. The raw data, originally in three separate sheets, has been consolidated and enriched with new columns for analysis purposes.

- **Analysis Sheet:** Contains pivot tables that summarize and visualize key insights from the cleaned data. It presents correlations between employee attrition and various parameters, including salary hikes, performance ratings, department-wise attrition, and other relevant factors impacting attrition.

- **Dashboard Sheet:** Hosts the interactive dashboard with dynamic visualizations and slicers. The dashboard utilizes the cleaned data to present key findings and allow users to interactively explore the data.

## 🌟 Tech Stack

- Power Query: Used for Data Cleaning, Processing, and Modeling.
- Power Bi: Used for Data analysis and Dashboard Making.

 ## 💡 Insights Derived
 
**Road Type Distribution**: A bar chart show the distribution of casualties based on road type . This can highlight whether accidents are more prevalent on certain types of roads.

**Urban vs. Rural Comparison**: A Pie chart compare casualties in urban and rural areas over time or by demographic factors. This can highlight whether accidents are more common in one type of area.

**Accident Heatmap**: A heatmap overlaid on a map can show the concentration of accidents in specific geographic areas. This can help identify accident hotspots, which are areas with a high number of casualties.

<br>

## 🔮 Future Scope

**Advanced Data Sources**: Integration of real-time data from IoT devices, traffic cameras, and connected vehicles for more accurate and timely analysis.

**Predictive Analytics**: Developing predictive models for accident prevention and early warning systems.

**Autonomous Vehicles**: Analyzing accidents involving autonomous vehicles and adapting safety measures accordingly.
